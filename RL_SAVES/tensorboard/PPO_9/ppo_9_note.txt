new params:

headless but show capture on, doing this because last time I ran it fully headless it crashed like 14 hrs in and idk how to fix it
n_steps=131072 (roughly 120 games per eval)
step_delay=0.00119047619 (1/840)
speed=126 (14x speed)
fps=840 (matching speed)
timesteps=8000000
So roughly 7324 games should be played


Note: Crashed around 2621440 steps/1945 games played and idk why
