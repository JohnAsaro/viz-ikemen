- only give reward if your guy wins, so reward 1 if win else no

- ai starts at lvl 1, which is random input, work up to lvl 4

- so I guess just learning of visual info? you CAN give it health reward shaping later but idk if that will help


- we can specify the amount of rounds we want to do when we initialize the env, actual load the game with one more round than that, 
so we can just reset the env through the reset cmd instead of relaunching the whole thing

- with my current screen buffer setup it will still send buffer if the window is covered, just not if its tabbed out, so make
note somewhere in the docs that you cant tab out but everything else should be fine, resizing the window also might mess with some 
training algorithms

TODO: 
- -stresstest can be used as frameskip from the command line (or can be copied and reworked to a function that lets you do vizdoom like frameskip)
- make amount of rounds a paramater instead of it being hardcoded one round
- look into the replay saving feature (if there is one, I think there is)
- maybe see if you can add a way to adjust the game framerate through launch options in the command line
- make a thing in env sqlite db that tells you if the game is paused either using sys.ispaused or flipping a bit whenever toggled, so we KNOW we are unpausing and pausing when we are supposed to
