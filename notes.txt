- lua to python communication with sqlite

- change num rounds to 1

- only give reward if your guy wins, so reward 1 if win else no

- ai starts at lvl 1, which is random input, work up to lvl 4

- so I guess just learning of visual info? you CAN give it health reward shaping later but idk if that will help

- should have ryu full move list as input space 

- 	// Execute a match of gameplay
	luaRegister(l, "game", func(l *lua.LState) int {
		// Anonymous function to load characters and stages, and/or wait for them to finish loading
^ might be a way to load straight into a game through lua scripting

^ counterpoint, main.lua is actually still loaded when you load the game through the command line, so it might work to just place all modded commands in there

-, -stresstest can be used as frameskip from the command line
