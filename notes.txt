- only give reward if your guy wins, so reward 1 if win else no

- ai starts at lvl 1, which is random input, work up to lvl 4

- so I guess just learning of visual info? you CAN give it health reward shaping later but idk if that will help

- should have ryu full move list as input space 

- -stresstest can be used as frameskip from the command line

- my options for sending input is either communicating through bitwise mapping with zss lua squlite and python (booooooooooooooooooo) or 
just formatting forceCommand like I would if building and ai in .cmd, luckily it seems like important calls like "ctrl" are in tact so I think
I can make it such that moves dont interact that make, which means after fixing up the sql to lua communication i get to work on the ryu ai again yayyy


luaRegister(l, "command", func(*lua.LState) int {
		l.Push(lua.LBool(sys.debugWC.commandByName(strArg(l, 1))))
		return 1
	})


luaRegister(l, "ctrl", func(*lua.LState) int {
	l.Push(lua.LBool(sys.debugWC.ctrl()))
	return 1
})

Reminder when porting over statedefs, triggerall must be met, trigger1-n just one of them have to be met,
so like trigger1 = 210 mean you can cancel from standing medium punch but dont have to
