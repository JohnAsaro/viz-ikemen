- only give reward if your guy wins, so reward 1 if win else no

- ai starts at lvl 1, which is random input, work up to lvl 4

- so I guess just learning of visual info? you CAN give it health reward shaping later but idk if that will help

- -stresstest can be used as frameskip from the command line

- important right now
    - to actually get the screen buffer properly in an efficent and cross platform way, ill have to mess with renderer.go

    - other way to do it is to make 2 scripts, 1 using win32api (done) and the other using x11

    - the other other way to do it is to put everything in a docker container

    - So as an addendum to the second thing, it would be a huge pain in the ass to maintain two wrappers, so i'm just going to
    remove hardcoded screen capture capability from the wrapper itself, and move all of that into whatever file I do visual
    reinforcement learning from, should be a very simple process tommorow and then I dont have to bother rewriting the
    whole thing to work with x11, because its just supposed to be a little test code
