NOTES: 

- Don't reszie the window it breaks it
- Don't resize window 
- Headless only works on linux
- The game doesnt seem to process the end of rounds properly when it is running really fast and headlessly

TODO: 
    -- important: make it so that multiple instances can be run in parallel

LESS IMPORTANT:
- make amount of rounds a paramater instead of it being hardcoded one round
- reward shaping with metadata can help but I dont wanna do that
- maybe try brute forcing hyperparameters with optuna?
- turn into full fledged library
