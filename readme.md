- Currently using 60 fps capped ikemen GO, will update this note in the future when that changes.
- Install Ikemen GO in Ikemen_GO folder, 6/9/25 nightly build of Ikemen GO required, otherwise compatibility with scripts not guaranteed, keep config.ini, select.def, and external_interface.lua from this repository over the Ikemen Nightly versions of those files.
- You might need luarocks, if you are on windows use this guide if you don't have it https://gist.github.com/Frityet/06ec8d5572b5ea08353c7de92cffc001
