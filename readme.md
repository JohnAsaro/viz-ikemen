# mugen-nn
- Trying to use a nn to train a bot to play mugen
- Assets taken originally from Street Fighter Alpha 3
- Used N64Mario84's (https://mugenarchive.com/forums/downloads.php?do=file&id=20417-ryu-n64mario) SFA Ryu as a base (for the most part, just removing some unnecessary sprites and things here and there), and built the AI for that
