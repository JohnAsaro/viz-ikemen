# mugen-nn
- Trying to use a nn to train a bot to play mugen
- Assets taken originally from Street Fighter Alpha 3
- Used N64Mario84's (https://mugenarchive.com/forums/downloads.php?do=file&id=20417-ryu-n64mario) SFA Ryu as a base. For the most part, just removing evil ryu and most palettes to simplify things
