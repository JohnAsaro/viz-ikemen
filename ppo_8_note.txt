 Changed gamespeed to 9 (105 fps internal gamespeed), 
 changed rendering fps to 105, 
 training in headless, 
 nerfed kfm again,
 3m steps I guess,
 n_steps up to 8192 (with the speed up should be like 5ish episodes per eval),
 disabling taunt from action space because its a waste of time and adds nothing to the ai except slowing down training
